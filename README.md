# embd++

This idea of this library is to provide a ready-to-go set of STL type headers that are ready to go on embedded.

This library also includes additional usefuls such as arrayAt<> and call<> as ways to pre-place arrays in fixed regions of memory (such as peripheral-provided buffers),
and to allow super cheap calling through many kinds of function-ish type

## Installing the library

TODO (Write Makefile first)

## Testing the library

Testing this library is really as simple as running ```make check``` at a command prompt.
